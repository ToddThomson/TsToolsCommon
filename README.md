# TsHelpers
ts2js is a simple, fast, extendable Typescript compiler.

## Wiki

Documentation can be found on the ts2js [wiki](https://github.com/ToddThomson/Ts2Js/wiki).

## How to install

```
npm install tshelpers
```
## Building

ts2js depends on [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) as a package manager and 
[Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) as a build tool. 
If you haven't already, you'll need to install both these tools in order to 
build TsHelpers.

Once Gulp is installed, you can build it with the following commands:

```
npm install
gulp build
```
